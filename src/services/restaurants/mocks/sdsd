Why context ??
Fetch the information that we need to fetch, getting the information we need to get,
but then also giving the ability for any level to consume that information.

context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having
to pass props down manually at every level.

Promise is like binding the contract that we are going to get
something in the future

this will return a function internally that has resolve and reject function

Fetch is one of the fetches, a standard that is build into every browser

and what fetch does is, it is an interface around promises that wraps the
ability to talk to external API

Fetch return in response as json object

json object is a simple javascript that return properties

map() is the function that will itterate over every individual
restaurant.

map() funciton is a method that allows us to create new array by
processing each element of an existing array. It allows us to
transform an array without modifying the original array.

context ko kaam : data lai globally data provide garney
inside the react application

service ko kaam : to determine what methods we want in
order to get data from external services

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (like latitude 37.423021 and longitude -122.083739), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position the map.

Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates into a human-readable address.

The Geocoding API provides a direct way to access these services via an HTTP request.
